Cars:
Write a function that stores information about a car in an Object. The function should always receive a
manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the
function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature.
Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
